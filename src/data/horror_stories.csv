I woke up to find a photo of myself sleeping—on my own phone.
The last sound I heard before waking up was my own voice calling my name.
"As I held the baby monitor, I realized I was the one whispering someone else’s lullaby."
"The mirror cracked, but the reflection only smiled."
He came home carrying flowers—though he’d died two weeks ago.
Every night the same shadow stood at the foot of my bed; one night it moved closer.
When I turned off the lights I saw the TV still playing—but no one was watching.
My cat curled up beside me and purred; then its eyes stared into the dark corner.
"I whispered 'I’m sorry' into the void—and the void whispered back, 'Thank you.'"
She told me she wasn’t afraid of the dark—until the darkness answered her.
My phone buzzed with a text from my wife; she was buried yesterday.
Someone knocked on my window from the tenth floor.
I watched the baby sleep peacefully until it opened my eyes.
"The reflection blinked, but I didn’t."
I keep hearing my mother calling me downstairs—but she’s sitting next to me.
I took a photo of the empty hallway; a hand waved back.
The voicemail was only breathing—but it came from my number.
The GPS kept saying 'You’ve arrived' long before I reached the house.
Something brushed my leg under the bed. I live alone.
"I kissed my husband goodnight, and he whispered, 'Who are you?'"
I locked the door and checked twice; someone locked it from the inside again.
The recording played my laughter—then another voice laughed with me.
My shadow stopped moving when I did.
The doll’s eyes were glass until they blinked.
I received an email from myself dated one year after my death.
"The lights flickered in Morse code, spelling my name."
"Every time I wash my hands, the water runs red for a moment."
"I told Alexa to turn off the lights. She said, 'But I’m not Alexa.'"
The portrait in the hallway aged overnight—just like me.
"I deleted the photo, but it keeps appearing on my lock screen."
"I sneezed, and someone whispered 'Bless you' from behind the mirror."
"I can still hear the heartbeat through the walls, though the house is empty."
My smartwatch says someone is holding my hand.
The music box only plays when no one is in the room.
The babysitter texted: 'Everything’s fine.' We don’t have a babysitter.
I found my diary rewritten in someone else’s handwriting.
"The elevator stopped between floors; a voice whispered, 'Finally, alone.'"
The footprints in the snow led to my door—but none led away.
"My voice assistant keeps asking, 'Shall I open the door now?'"
I keep deleting the same message: 'I see you.'
The grave I visited today had my name freshly carved on it.
The whispers stopped when I covered my ears—then started inside my head.
I thought I was humming alone until something harmonized.
I woke up from a nightmare to find the dream still watching me.
The house lights turn off one by one—except in the room I’m in.
"The photograph showed everyone smiling—except me, I wasn’t there."
The echo said my name twice.
I found a tooth in my soup. I live alone.
The ceiling fan spelled something with its creaks: 'RUN.'
I keep finding notes in my handwriting that I don’t remember writing.
"At 3:00 AM, the baby monitor whispered, 'He’s awake now.'"
"The voicemail from my dead sister said, 'Don’t come home.'"
My dog growled at the corner—then his tail wagged.
I can’t find the door I entered this room through.
"The voice said 'Turn around,' and I did—but there was still someone behind me."
I watched myself walk past the window.
My reflection mouthed a word I didn’t say: 'Soon.'
All the family portraits have a new person in them tonight.
I dreamt I was drowning and woke up coughing up water.
I opened the closet. Something closed it from the inside.
"The candle went out, but the shadow remained."
"I asked my son who he was talking to. He said, 'The man in your chair.'"
"The voicemail said, 'We’re here now.' It was my own voice."
"I turned off the baby monitor; the whisper said, 'You shouldn’t have done that.'"
"I tried to scream, but the recording stayed silent."
"My husband texted, 'I’m home.' The doorbell rang a minute later."
I found a mirror in the attic—my reflection was already smiling.
"I tucked my daughter into bed; she asked, 'Who’s sleeping next to me?'"
"The nightlight went out, but something was glowing under the bed."
I woke up to my cat purring on my chest—then I remembered she died last week.
"The man in my dream said, 'See you soon.' He was my doctor this morning."
The footprints on my ceiling are getting closer to my bed.
The basement door keeps unlocking itself every night at 2:17 AM.
I recorded white noise to fall asleep; I heard my name in the playback.
I took a selfie and saw someone standing behind me.
I looked out the window and saw myself walking up the driveway.
The doorbell camera shows someone knocking—from the inside.
The whispers stopped when I turned off the light—but not the breathing.
"I can’t find my phone, but something is typing on my laptop."
My favorite song started playing from an unplugged speaker.
I found handprints on the inside of my mirror.
"The voice on the radio said, 'Look behind you.'"
The lullaby stopped halfway through—then someone finished it in my voice.
"I turned off my alarm clock; it said, 'Don’t oversleep again.'"
The neighbor’s lights flicker in sync with my heartbeat.
"I looked at the stars, and one of them blinked back."
I was home alone when my phone got an AirDrop request labeled 'me.jpg'.
My reflection waved first.
I deleted the security footage; it uploaded itself again.
"The doll’s head turned toward me and whispered, 'Mommy?'"
I heard a knock on the coffin—before it was buried.
"The nursery mobile started spinning backwards, singing a name we never chose."
"The last text I got said, 'I’m outside.' Then the lights went out."
I set my phone to airplane mode; it still received a message from 'Unknown Passenger.'
I woke up cold because the blanket was tucked in around someone else.
My child’s imaginary friend just told me my secrets.
The lights flickered in Morse code: S-O-S.
I pressed the elevator button for floor 1—it went to floor 13.
"My wallpaper app keeps showing pictures of my bedroom, but messier."
The door creaks every time I breathe in.
I said goodnight to my roommate. She moved out last month.
I keep hearing typing in the next room. My laptop is in there.
I found a fingerprint inside my eye.
